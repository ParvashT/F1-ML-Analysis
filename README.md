## 🔄 Feature Scaling Techniques
### **1️⃣ MinMaxScaler**
Each value in a feature is transformed by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range (max-min). This scaler **preserves the shape of the original distribution**.

![d356ff52-5788-478c-b3b9-15abe8c71927](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e44a301d-aa81-46ae-8ea1-b1c67d042080)


### **2️⃣ StandardScaler**
Removes the mean and scales each feature to unit variance. This method is **sensitive to outliers**.

### **3️⃣ RobustScaler**
Uses statistics robust to outliers by scaling data based on the **interquartile range (IQR)**.
